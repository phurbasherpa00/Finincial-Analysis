# Finincial-Analysis

Southern Water Corp sells two types of water product; Hard and Soft Water which is retailed to Residential, Public and Private Customers. 
These sales (Revenues) are stored in centres known as PROFIT CENTRES. 


Profit Centres - These are centres which handle all the revenue generating activities. 
These are then broken down further into Profit Centre Elements of which there are two, one for each water product (Soft Water and Hard Water).

Cost Centres - There are centres which handle all cost generating activities. 
If a business has set costs, they will normally flow through to a cost centre for capture. 


In most cases, ONLY costs flow through Cost Centres, but depending on company set up - you may have the rare instance where there are revenue-generating activities included in Cost Centres. 
For Southern Water Corp, we've simplified this structure so revenues stay in Profit Centres and Costs stay in Cost Centres.
